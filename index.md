zwickau-mensa
-------------
with java &ndash; on
[github](https://github.com/mabako/zwickau-mensa),
[google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mabako.zwickau.mensa)

Simple Android application that provides me with my university's food today,
tomorrow and in two days. The name is a derivate of the location, as it happens
to be Zwickau.

Menus are different for Android 2.x and Android 3+, the latter uses the
action bar instead of the menu key.

IV, rather simple and unpolished as of now. Was in a different repository
before it became public, hence most of the commit history was lost.
